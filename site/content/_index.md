# Introduction

Welcome to Pixelsnake! Pixelsnake is a mod of pixelflut, but instead of writing
pixels to the screen, you just control a colored snake that leaves a trail
behind it as it moves!

From the [original author](https://github.com/defnull/pixelflut) of pixelflut:

> Pixelflut is a very simple (and inefficient) ASCII based network protocol to
> draw pixels on a screen. You can write a basic client in a single line of
> shell code if you want, but you only get to change a single pixel at a time.
> If you want to get rectangles, lines, text or images on the screen you have
> to implement that functionality yourself. That is part of the game.

Essentially, it's a giant, shared multiplayer canvas that you can draw on with
loads of other people. You can draw your own stuff or draw over other people's
and collaborate with them as you like.
